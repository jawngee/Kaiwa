#Kaiwa#
Kaiwa is a cocoa/cocoatouch framework for adding a HTTP interface to your application, as well as allowing
communication between Kaiwa enabled applications.

You can sort of think of it as an embeddable objective-c Rails-esque application framework.  Or something like that.

Essentially, your application will now have a multithreaded HTTP interface to it with the ability to disptach incoming
http requests to classes and methods in your application through an application defined routing.
